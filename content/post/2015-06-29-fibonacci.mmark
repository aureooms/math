The Fibonacci numbers are defined as $$f_0 = 0,\ f_1 = 1$$ and, for $$i \ge
2,\ f_i = f_{i-1} + f_{i-2}$$. Here is the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:

$$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots$$

We generalize the definition above by changing the two initial values, for
example with $$f_0 = 4,\ f_1 = 6$$ we obtain

$$4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 42, \ldots$$

Multiplying such a sequence by a scalar or adding two such sequences gives
again such a sequence. The sum of the two previous sequences is

$$4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, \ldots$$

The set $$V$$ of sequences $$(x_i)$$ of real numbers satisfying
$$x_i = x_{i-1} + x_{i-2}$$ for $$i \ge 2$$ form a real vector space. A
basis of this vector space is formed by the two vectors

$$\vec{e}_1: 0, 1 , 1, 2, 3, 5, \ldots$$

$$\vec{e}_2: 1, 0 , 1, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$$

Indeed, any sequence in $$V$$, say
$$s: x_0, x_1, (x_0 + x_1), (x_0 + 2 x_1), \ldots$$
can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the two sequences
$$\vec{e}_1$$ and $$\vec{e}_2$$, that is,

$$x_0 \vec{e}_2 + x_1 \vec{e}_1$$.

We ask ourselves for which real(s) $$r \neq 0 $$ the sequence $$x_i$$
with $$x_i = r^i$$ is in $$V$$. The answer is: if and only if
$$\forall i \ge 2,\ r^i = r^{i-1} + r^{i-2},$$
that is,
$$r^2 = r + 1 \iff r^2 - r - 1 = 0,$$
that is,

$$r = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}.$$

Another basis is thus formed by the two sequences

$$\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i \text{ and } \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i.$$

We express the Fibonacci sequence in this basis. We must have for all $$i \ge
0$$

$$f_i = \lambda \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i + \mu \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i$$
thus

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{for } i = 0 \text{:}\hskip 3em& 0 = \lambda + \mu\\
\text{for } i = 1 \text{:}\hskip 3em& 1 = \lambda \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) + \mu \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

from there

$$
\begin{cases}
\lambda = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}\\
\mu = -\frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}
\end{cases}
$$

and finally

$$f_i = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} \left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5} \left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^i.$$
