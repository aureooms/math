The erroneous proof I hear most often is: Suppose $$P$$ is a
finite set that contains all the primes, then $$p^* = 1 + \prod_{p \in P} p$$ is
prime. Indeed, the flaw is that $$p^*$$ is not necessarily prime but rather
must be a multiple of some prime not in $$P$$.

The previous proof is so often misquoted that I prefer the following. It
relies on the fact that a finite product of sums of infinite geometric series
converges, whereas the sum of the reciprocals of the natural numbers (except
zero) diverges (hint: $$\int$$).

$$
  \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}
= \prod_{p~\text{is prime}} \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} p^{-j}
= \prod_{p~\text{is prime}} \frac{p}{p-1}.
$$
