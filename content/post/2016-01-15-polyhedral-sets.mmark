A *polyhedral set* in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ is the intersection of a finite
number of closed halfspaces, and a *(convex) polytope* is a bounded polyhedral
set. This definition of a polytope is called a *halfspace representation*
(*H-representation* or *H-description*).

<!--more-->
A *defining halfspace* of a polyhedral set $$P$$ is a facet-defining
halfspace for $$P$$.

A *$$k$$-face* of a polyhedral set $$P$$ is the intersection of $$P$$
with $$d-k$$ (non-redundant) hyperplanes defining $$P$$. *Vertices*, *edges*,
and *facets* are $$0$$-, $$1$$-, and $$(d-1)$$-faces.

There exist infinitely many
H-descriptions of a convex polytope. However, for a full-dimensional convex
polytope, the minimal H-description is in fact unique and is given by the set
of the facet-defining halfspaces.

The set of *extreme points* (vertices) of a polyhedral set $$P$$ will be
denoted $$\mathop{ext} P$$.

The set of *extreme rays* of $$P$$, $$\mathop{extr} P$$, is the set of
rays $$e$$ emanating from the origin $$0$$ such that there is some point
$$q \in P$$ for which $$(q+e)$$ is an edge of $$P$$ (here '+' between
pointsets means pointwise sum).

A *$$k$$-simplex* $$S$$ is a $$k$$-dimensional polytope with
$$|\mathop{ext} S| = k+1$$.

A nonzero element $$x$$ of a polyhedral cone $$C \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$$
is called an extreme ray if there are $$n âˆ’ 1$$ linearly independent
constraints binding at $$x$$.

An extreme ray of the recession cone associated with a polyhedral set $$P$$ is
also called an extreme ray of $$P$$.
