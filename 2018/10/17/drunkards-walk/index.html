    <h1>The Drunkard's Walk</h1>
    <h4>Wed, Oct 17, 2018</h4>
    <p><p>A drunkard is zigzagging home. At every steps forward (or backward) he is
making, he also moves <span  class="math">\(1\)</span> step to the left with probability <span  class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(1\)</span>
step to the right otherwise. He starts <span  class="math">\(i\)</span> steps to the right of a river. What is
the expected number of steps forward before he falls into the river?</p>

<p></p>

<p>We model the expected number of steps before the drunkard falls into the river
by <span  class="math">\(A(i)\)</span> when the drunkard starts <span  class="math">\(i\)</span> steps to the right of the river.</p>

<p>If the drunkard starts his walk after having fallen into the river,
then he does not even need to move
<span  class="math">\(
A(0) = 0
\)</span></p>

<p>The statement of the problem allows us to express <span  class="math">\(A(i)\)</span> with respect to its
neighbouring values.
<span  class="math">\(
A(i) = p A(i-1) + (1-p) A(i+1) + 1
\)</span></p>

<p>Another important point is that the expected number of steps before the fall is
the same as the sum of the expected number of steps before moving one step
towards the river by linearity of expectation. Hence,
<span  class="math">\(
A(i) = i A(1)
\)</span></p>

<p>Solving for <span  class="math">\(i=1\)</span>,
<span  class="math">\(
A(1) = p A(0) + (1-p) A(2) + 1
\)</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
A(1) = (2-2p) A(1) + 1
\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
A(1) (2p - 1) = 1
\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[
A(1) = \frac{1}{2p-1}
\]</span></p>

<p>And finally
<span  class="math">\(
A(i) = \frac{i}{2p-1}
\)</span></p>

<p>The problem can also be stated with the drunkard moving forward with
probability <span  class="math">\(p\)</span> and backwards otherwise. Then ask what is the expected time
before the drunkard reaches home (provided forward means in the direction of
his home).</p></p>
